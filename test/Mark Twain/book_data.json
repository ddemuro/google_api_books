His innovative notion\u2014to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"\u2014meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak his \"whole frank mind.\" The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone and in honor of the cherished tradition of publishing Mark Twain's works, UC Press is proud to offer for the first time Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography in its entirety and exactly as he left it. This major literary event brings to readers, admirers, and scholars the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended.

The genial humorist of the earlier day is now a reformer of the vigorous kind, a sort of knight errant who does not hesitate to break a lance with either Church or State if he thinks them interposing on that broad highway over which he believes not a part but the whole of mankind has the privilege of passing in the onward march of the ages.\" Mark Twain had begun \"breaking the lance\" very soon after his return from Europe. He did not believe that he could reform the world, but at least he need not withhold his protest against those things which stirred his wrath. He began by causing the arrest of a cabman who had not only overcharged but insulted him; he continued by writing openly against the American policy in the Philippines, the missionary propaganda which had resulted in the Chinese uprising and massacre, and against Tammany politics. Not all of his efforts were in the line of reform; he had become a sort of general spokesman which the public flocked to hear, whatever the subject. On the occasion of a Lincoln Birthday service at Carnegie Hall he was chosen to preside, and he was obliged to attend more dinners than were good for his health. His letters of this period were mainly written to his old friend Twichell, in Hartford. Howells, who lived in New York, he saw with considerable frequency.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1595403248"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781595403247"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 212, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.6.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:mark+twain&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HfPADSVaw9sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 0.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 0.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&rdid=book-HfPADSVaw9sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Letters_of_Mark_Twain-sample-pdf.acsm?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HfPADSVaw9sC&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot; Mark Twain had begun &quot;breaking the lance&quot; very soon after his return from Europe.
